# HAYL Hybrid III — 90 Min Hypertrophy Split

**Duration**: 90 min | **Split**: 2-Day (Legs/Biceps + Upper/Back) | **Focus**: Hypertrophy | **Level**: Hybrid+

## Why This Program
With 90 minutes, this plan pushes volume to the limit. Heavy main lifts, extensive circuits, and high-intensity techniques like drop sets and partials for maximal growth stimulus.

## Core Principles
- **Time Under Tension** — every accessory set lasts 30-45 seconds
- **Volume Ceiling** — the 90-minute window unlocks more sets than a standard split
- **Drop Sets & Partials** — used on finishers to push past failure
- **Deadlift Resets** — mandatory for the first 3 heavy sets

## Coach's Notes
> This is our most demanding Hybrid hypertrophy template. If you're not training 4x/week consistently, start with Hybrid I before graduating here.

## Equipment
Barbell, Dumbbells, Cable Machine, Lat Pull-down, Leg Press, Adductor/Abductor Machines

## The Power of the 90-Minute Session

**Volume-Targeted Hypertrophy**  
When training a muscle 2x per week, 90 minutes allows for a "volume block" that would be impossible in 60 minutes. This is where you build the work capacity of a high-level athlete.

**Drop Sets: The Growth Trigger**  
By dropping the weight 30% and going to absolute failure, you recruit every available motor unit, providing a stimulus that straight sets sometimes lack.

**Mind-Muscle Connection**  
The extensive circuit in Part 2 is designed to create a massive pump and reinforce the connection with every minor muscle group, from traps to adductors.
