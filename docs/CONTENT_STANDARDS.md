# Hayl Content Standards: The Authenticity Protocol

> **Philosophy**: "If it looks like content, it fails. If it looks like training, it passes."

This document defines the strict criteria for all exercise demonstrations in the Hayl Exercise Bank. These rules are non-negotiable to ensuring the platform remains a tool for serious training, not social media consumption.

## 1. Source Authority (The "No Influencer" Rule)

We do not accept content from generic fitness influencers. Content must be sourced from commercially neutral, highly credible technical authorities.

### ✅ Approved Sources

- **Renaissance Periodization (RP)**: Gold standard for hypertrophy mechanics. (Dr. Mike Israetel).
- **Jeff Nippard**: High-quality, science-based technique.
- **John Meadows (Mountain Dog)**: Valid for specific bodybuilding variations.
- **Squat University (Dr. Aaron Horschig)**: Gold standard for rehabilitation/mobility context.
- **EliteFTS (Dave Tate)**: Valid for powerlifting mechanics (Request explicit approval).
- **Official Equipment Manufacturers**: (e.g., Rogue, Kabuki Strength) if the demo is technical.

### ⛔ Banned Sources ("The Slop List")

- **TikTok-first Influencers**: Anyone whose primary content is "trends" or "challenges".
- **"Vlog Style" Content**: Videos with extensive talking heads, intros, or vlogging before the lift.
- **Sexualized Content**: Any content where attire or angles are designed for engagement rather than instruction.
- **Compilations**: "Best Exercises for X" compilations. We need individual, focused clips.

## 2. Bio-Mechanical Integrity

The movement demonstrated must be the **textbook execution** of the lift, prioritizing muscle target over load.

- **Full Range of Motion (ROM)**: Deep squats (below parallel), full extension on pushes. No half-reps unless specifically "Partials".
- **Control (Eccentric)**: The lowering phase must be controlled. No dropping weights (unless Deadlift/Oly lifts).
- **Standard Stance**: No "sumo" for conventional deadlifts, no "wide stance" for standard squats, unless the exercise is explicitly labeled as such.
- **Neutral Spine**: No excessive arching (bench press arch is acceptable if within powerlifting standards, but moderate is preferred for general hypertrophy).

## 3. Visual Standard (The "Clean Feed")

We are building a database, not a feed. The visual must be clinical.

- **Camera Stability**: Tripod or fixed camera only. No "handheld shaky cam".
- **Angle**:
  - **Unilateral/Asymmetrical**: 45-degree offset is best (e.g., Lunges, Rows).
  - **Compound (Squat/DL)**: Side profile or 45-degree.
  - **Isolation (Curls/Extensions)**: Direct side or direct front.
  - _Reject_: "Crotch shots", top-down drone shots, or extreme fisheye distortions.
- **Environment**:
  - **Preferred**: Minimalist gyms, garage gyms, plain walls.
  - **Acceptable**: Commercial gyms if background is not chaotic.
  - **Reject**: Bedrooms, crowded floors where people walk in front, dark/gloomy lighting.
- **Attire**:
  - Must allow visibility of joint mechanics (knees, hips, elbows/shoulders).
  - No oversized hoodies that hide spinal position.

## 4. Technical Specifications (The "Loop")

### Format

- **Duration**: 3–8 seconds.
- **Loopability**: Perfect loops are the goal. The start frame and end frame should be mechanically similar (e.g., lock-out to lock-out).
- **Reps**: 1.5 to 2 reps maximum. We do not need a set of 10.
- **Audio**: **ALWAYS MUTED**. Remove audio track entirely during processing.

### Cropping

- **Aspect Ratio**:
  - **Mobile First**: Vertical (9:16) or Square (1:1).
  - **Landscape (16:9)**: Accepted but will be center-cropped.
- **Framing**: The athlete must remain in the center 75% of the frame. Extremities (hands/feet) should not leave the frame.

## 5. Metadata Rules

Every ingested exercise must have the following tags manually or automatically verified:

- `primary_muscle`: (e.g., "Latissimus Dorsi")
- `mechanic`: (Compound vs. Isolation)
- `equipment`: (Barbell, Dumbbell, Cable, Machine)
- `force`: (Push, Pull, Static)
